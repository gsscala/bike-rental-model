# bike-rental-model

## The [step-by-step guide](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html) is described by Microsoft.

This project was interesting as it served to me as an introductory pratical course to AI in general and to M's Azure, specifically. By feeding it with ```daily-bike-share.csv```, a table with historical data on bike rental, a model was created. This model then tried to predict what the numbers would be when using different parameters, described in ```input_data.json```. It is interesting to note the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning and its usefulness in various fields.
